######################

This folder must be the target of PDE exports. After the export, you **don't**
have to move all files from the plugins subdirectory to this one.

Bundle export can be done using the PDE *Deployable plugins and fragments*
export wizard with the following settings :

* **Directory** : /platforms/base/repo
* **Use class files compiled in the workspace** (mandatory if you use the iPOJO
  Builder plug-in)
