iPOPO: the component framework
##############################

This tutorial shows how to work with the iPOPO framework.

.. todo:: To be completed

Install the iPOPO bundle
************************

iPOPO is a simple bundle that has to be installed in a Pelix framework instance.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> # Import the Pelix module
   >>> import pelix.framework as pelix
   >>> # Start the framework
   >>> framework = pelix.FrameworkFactory.get_framework()   
   >>> # Get the bundle context
   >>> context = framework.get_bundle_context()
   
   >>> # Install and start the bundle
   >>> bundle_id = context.install_bundle("pelix.ipopo.core")
   >>> bundle = context.get_bundle(bundle_id)
   >>> bundle.start()
   
   >>> # Get the iPOPO service
   >>> from pelix.ipopo.constants import IPOPO_SERVICE_SPECIFICATION
   >>> ipopo_ref = context.get_service_reference(IPOPO_SERVICE_SPECIFICATION)
   >>> ipopo = context.get_service(ipopo_ref)


Write a component factory
*************************

The principle of iPOPO is to handle the life cycle of components which are
instances of factory classes.

Here is a sample factory class:

.. code-block:: python

     from pelix.ipopo.decorators import *
     import pelix.ipopo.constants as constants

     # The component manipulator
     @ComponentFactory(name="MyIncrementerFactory")
     # Tell we want an instance of this factory
     @Instantiate("MyIncrementer")
     # An injected property field, here the component instance name
     @Property("name", constants.IPOPO_INSTANCE_NAME)
     # A component specific property, with a default value
     @Property("thread_safe", "thread.safe", False)
     @Property("usable", "usable", True)
     @Provides(specifications="my.incrementer")
     class ComponentIncrementer(object):
         """
         Sample Incrementer
         """
         def change(self, usable):
             """
             Changes the usable property
             """
             self.usable = usable 

         def increment(self):
             """
             Service implementation
             """
             self.count += 1
             return self.count
         
         @Validate
         def validate(self, context):
             """
             Component validated
             """
             self.count = 0
             print "%s: Ready..." % self.name
         
         @Invalidate
         def invalidate(self, context):
             """
             Component invalidated
             """
             self.count = 0
             print "%s: Gone." % self.name


When the bundle containing this class will be started, its factories will be
loaded and the requested components will be instantiated, if possible.

.. code-block:: python

     >>> bid = context.install_bundle("test_ipopo")
     >>> bundle = context.get_bundle(bid)
     >>> bundle.start()
     MyIncrementer: Ready...


Use the iPOPO service
*********************

The iPOPO service provides three methods :

* ``instantiate(factory_name, name, properties)`` : starts a new component from
  the given factory, with the given name and properties. If a component with
  the same name already exists, the instantiation fails.

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> # Starts a new incrementer
     >>> compo = ipopo.instantiate("MyIncrementerFactory", "incr2",
                                   {"usable": False})
     MyIncrementer: Ready...
     >>> compo.increment()
     1

* ``invalidate(name)`` : invalidates the component with the given name. This
  is a test method, as the component will be automatically re-validated when a
  new service event will be triggered.

* ``kill(name)`` : destroys the component with the given name. The component is
  invalidated then removed from the iPOPO registry.

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> # Invalidates the started incrementer
     >>> ipopo.kill("incr2")
     MyIncrementer: Gone.


Component dependencies
**********************

Component dependencies is based on services, provided by ones and consumed by
others.

In the following example, the consumer requires an incrementer.

.. code-block:: python

   @ComponentFactory("ConsumerFactory")
   @Requires("svc", "my.incrementer", spec_filter="(usable=True)")
   class ConsumerFactory(object):
   
      @Validate
      def validate(self, context):
          print "Start:", self.svc.increment()
      
      @Invalidate
      def invalidate(self, context):
          print "Stopped:", self.svc.increment()
      

The service is injected before the component is validated and after it is
invalidated. That way, it can be used by the consumer can use it a last time
when the service or the consumer is invalidated.

A sample run, considering all bundles are started :

.. code-block:: python

   >>> # Remember, a component named "MyIncrementer" has automatically been
   >>> # started by iPOPO (@Instantiate decorator on the factory)
   >>> consumer = ipopo.instantiate("ConsumerFactory", "consumer")
   Start: 1
   
   >>> # Start the second incrementer
   >>> incr2 = ipopo.instantiate("MyIncrementerFactory", "incr2",
                                 {"usable": True})
   incr2: Ready...
   
   >>> # Set the first incrementer unusable : the injection will be updated.
   >>> # As the injection is not optional, the consumer will be invalidated
   >>> # during the re-injection
   >>> consumer.svc.change(False)
   Stopped: 2
   Start: 1
   
   >>> # Set the second incrementer unusable, it will invalidate the consumer
   >>> incr2.change(False)
   Stopped: 2
   
   >>> # Set the second incrementer usable again
   >>> incr2.change(True)
   Start: 3
